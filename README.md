ageliaco.schoolsite
===================

Plone site customization package for upper secondary schools in Geneva, developed by the AGELIACO community.

Only tested on Plone 4.3 for now.

Dependencies
------------

- collective.makesitestructure: https://github.com/kamon/collective.makesitestructure
  Would be nice, later, to reduce the code there, and even remove that dependency, by using plone.api.

TODO
----

- Add an Admin page (configlet) that provides the links to our admin interfaces, such as the @@quickadd-users-groups view,
  and useful technical information. [Near Term]
  
- Update the CSS with more common rules for school sites. [Immediate Term]

- Add tests to the package. [Near Term]
